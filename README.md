===========================

---------------------------

The JerboBot operates off a BeagleBone Black, with a modified
Beaglebone Cape, graciously provided by Peter Gaskell of UM EECS.
The code structure is largely based on the libraries provided with
the Beaglebone Black, particularly those in the rc_balance.c 
example. 

For any questions contact Taylor Sun or Dan Yuan.
